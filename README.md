# Lua Bundler

- Obs: More tests needed.

- This is a Lua module that can be used to bundle other Lua modules into a single file. The bundled module can then be used as a regular Lua module.

# Features

- The module can be built as a library, which can then be used as a regular Lua module.
- A module can be bundled using another previously bundled module. The code generated by this bundler will be ignored, and only the real library's Lua code will be used for the "re-bundling".
- Pre-processing directives to ignore pieces of code.

# Directives

- Any code between `--! skip` and `--! endskip` will not be written into the output file.

# TODO

- Implement pre-processing directives conditionals
- Rewrite README to be more clear and concise
